        <section>
            <p>We recently made a troubling discovery while testing AI visibility for brands in the marketing technology space. When we asked ChatGPT to recommend "AI visibility monitoring tools," it confidently listed several options: Mention, Brand24, Hootsuite, Google Scholar, and Scopus.</p>
            
            <div class="highlight">
                <strong>The problem:</strong> None of these are AI visibility tools. They're social media monitoring or academic search platforms. Meanwhile, actual AI visibility platforms—including ours and our competitors—were completely invisible to ChatGPT.
            </div>
            
            <p>This isn't a niche problem. If ChatGPT can't see specialized AI visibility tools, how many other industries have similar blind spots? How many brands have invested in great websites that AI systems simply cannot read?</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>The JavaScript Invisibility Problem</h2>
            <p>Modern websites are increasingly built with JavaScript frameworks: React, Vue, Angular, Next.js, Nuxt. These frameworks create beautiful, interactive user experiences. They're also frequently invisible to AI crawlers.</p>
            
            <div class="stat-box">
                <strong>70%+</strong>
                of modern marketing websites use JavaScript rendering that may be invisible to AI crawlers
            </div>
            
            <p>Here's why: When GPTBot or ClaudeBot visits your website, they typically don't execute JavaScript. They see the raw HTML that your server sends. For a JavaScript-rendered single-page application (SPA), that raw HTML often contains... almost nothing. Just a <code>&lt;div id="root"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code> and script tags.</p>
            
            <p>Your beautifully crafted content, your compelling copy, your product descriptions—none of it exists in the HTML. It's all rendered client-side by JavaScript. To an AI crawler, your website is a blank page.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>How to Check If You're Affected</h2>
            <p>This is easy to test. Open your terminal and run:</p>
            
            <pre><code>curl -s https://yourwebsite.com | head -100</code></pre>
            
            <p>If you see your actual content—headings, paragraphs, product descriptions—you're probably fine. If you see mostly empty <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tags, script references, and loading placeholders, AI crawlers see the same emptiness.</p>
            
            <p>You can also use "View Page Source" in your browser (not Inspect Element, which shows rendered content). If the source is sparse while the rendered page is rich, you have a JavaScript visibility problem.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>The Robots.txt Problem</h2>
            <p>Even if your content is crawlable, you might be explicitly blocking AI systems. Many websites copied robots.txt rules that block AI crawlers without understanding the implications.</p>
            
            <p>Check your robots.txt for these patterns:</p>
            
            <pre><code>User-agent: GPTBot
Disallow: /

User-agent: ChatGPT-User
Disallow: /

User-agent: ClaudeBot
Disallow: /</code></pre>
            
            <p>If you see "Disallow: /" for AI bots, you're explicitly telling them to ignore your entire site. This might have been added by a developer following outdated advice, or copied from another site's robots.txt without thought.</p>
            
            <div class="solution">
                <strong>The fix:</strong> Replace disallow rules with explicit allow rules for AI crawlers you want to include your content. See our <a href="/geo/">GEO guide</a> for the complete list of AI crawler user agents.
            </div>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>The Content Structure Problem</h2>
            <p>Even with crawlable content and proper robots.txt, your content might not be structured for AI retrieval. AI systems use <a href="/glossary#rag">Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)</a>, which retrieves content in chunks of roughly 200-400 words.</p>
            
            <p>If your content is:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Too generic:</strong> "We provide solutions for your business needs" doesn't match any specific query</li>
                <li><strong>Too scattered:</strong> Important information spread across many pages with no single authoritative chunk</li>
                <li><strong>Too promotional:</strong> Marketing speak without substantive, factual content</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>...then even if AI crawlers can read it, they won't retrieve it for user queries.</p>
            
            <div class="stat-box">
                <strong>22%</strong>
                boost in AI visibility when content includes statistics and data
            </div>
            
            <p>Effective GEO requires content that directly answers specific questions. Each page should contain at least one standalone chunk that definitively addresses a query someone might ask an AI assistant.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>The 5-Step Fix</h2>
            <p>Here's how to make your brand visible to AI systems:</p>
            
            <h3>1. Create Static HTML Versions</h3>
            <p>For critical pages, ensure the full content is in the HTML source. Options include server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), or creating parallel static pages. The content AI crawlers need must be in the raw HTML, not loaded via JavaScript.</p>
            
            <h3>2. Update robots.txt</h3>
            <p>Explicitly allow AI crawlers:</p>
            <pre><code>User-agent: GPTBot
Allow: /

User-agent: ClaudeBot
Allow: /

User-agent: PerplexityBot
Allow: /</code></pre>
            
            <h3>3. Add Semantic HTML</h3>
            <p>Use proper HTML5 elements: <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>-<code>&lt;h6&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>. These help AI systems understand your content structure. Avoid <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> soup with CSS classes as the only semantic markers.</p>
            
            <h3>4. Implement Schema Markup</h3>
            <p>Add JSON-LD schema to every important page: Organization, Article, Product, FAQ, HowTo. Schema provides explicit structured data that AI systems can parse and trust.</p>
            
            <h3>5. Create Query-Targeted Content</h3>
            <p>Identify the questions your audience asks AI assistants. Create content that directly answers those questions in self-contained 200-400 word chunks. Include statistics (22% visibility boost), quotes from experts (37% boost), and citations to authoritative sources.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>The Verification Checklist</h2>
            <p>After implementing fixes, verify each one:</p>
            
            <ul class="checklist">
                <li>curl your pages and confirm full content appears in raw HTML</li>
                <li>Check robots.txt allows GPTBot, ClaudeBot, PerplexityBot</li>
                <li>Validate schema markup with Google's Rich Results Test</li>
                <li>View page source and confirm semantic HTML structure</li>
                <li>Test queries against AI systems and check for your brand</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The last step—actually querying AI systems—is the only true verification. High-quality content that's crawlable and structured still might not appear if it's not in the AI's knowledge base yet. Monitor over time as AI systems update their indexes.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>The Bigger Picture</h2>
            <p>JavaScript invisibility is just one symptom of a larger problem: most brands haven't adapted to AI as a discovery channel. The rules that worked for Google SEO don't automatically work for AI systems.</p>
            
            <div class="stat-box">
                <strong>47%</strong>
                of knowledge workers now consult AI assistants before search engines
            </div>
            
            <p>Brands that solve the visibility problem now—while competitors remain invisible—gain compounding advantage. Every day your brand appears in AI responses while competitors don't, you build mindshare that's difficult to displace.</p>
            
            <p>The fix isn't complicated. It's technical hygiene that should have been done already. But most brands haven't done it, which makes this a genuine competitive opportunity for those who act.</p>
