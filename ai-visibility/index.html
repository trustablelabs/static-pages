    <h1>What is AI Visibility?</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Understanding how your brand appears in ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, and other AI systems.</p>

    <div class="definition-box">
        <p><strong>AI Visibility</strong> refers to how a brand, product, or organization appears in responses generated by artificial intelligence systems. When someone asks ChatGPT "What's the best project management tool?" or Perplexity "Which CRM should I use?" — AI visibility determines whether your brand is mentioned, how accurately it's described, and whether it's recommended.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Why AI Visibility Matters</h2>
    
    <p>The way people discover products and services is fundamentally changing. Instead of searching Google and clicking through results, users increasingly ask AI systems directly and receive synthesized answers.</p>
    
    <div class="stat-box">
        <h4>30:1</h4>
        <p>The gap between brand recognition (when asked by name) and organic discovery (when asking for recommendations) in AI systems. Research shows ChatGPT recognizes 99.4% of brands by name but only surfaces 3.32% in discovery queries.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>This gap represents a massive opportunity — and risk. Brands that achieve AI visibility capture demand at the moment of decision. Brands that don't are invisible to a growing segment of buyers.</p>

    <h2>Components of AI Visibility</h2>
    
    <h3>1. Brand Recognition</h3>
    <p>Does the AI know your brand exists? When someone asks "Tell me about [Brand]," does the AI return accurate information? This is the foundation of AI visibility.</p>
    
    <h3>2. Category Association</h3>
    <p>Is your brand associated with the right categories? When someone asks for "the best [category] tools," is your brand mentioned? This requires the AI to understand what you do and consider you relevant.</p>
    
    <h3>3. Recommendation Inclusion</h3>
    <p>Does the AI actively recommend your brand? Being known is different from being recommended. Recommendation requires the AI to perceive your brand as a good choice worth suggesting.</p>
    
    <h3>4. Information Accuracy</h3>
    <p>Is what the AI says about you correct? AI systems can hallucinate or have outdated information. Monitoring and correcting inaccuracies is part of maintaining AI visibility.</p>

    <h2>Measuring AI Visibility</h2>
    
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Metric</th>
            <th>What It Measures</th>
            <th>How to Track</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Citation Frequency</td>
            <td>How often AI mentions your brand for target queries</td>
            <td>Query AI systems with relevant prompts, track mentions</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Citation Accuracy</td>
            <td>Whether AI information about you is correct</td>
            <td>Compare AI responses to your actual product/service</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Competitive Position</td>
            <td>Where you appear relative to competitors</td>
            <td>Track mention order and frequency vs competitors</td>
        </tr>

            <td>Query Coverage</td>
            <td>Percentage of relevant queries that mention you</td>

        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Sentiment</td>
            <td>How positively/negatively AI describes you</td>
            <td>Analyze language and recommendations in responses</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h2>Factors That Influence AI Visibility</h2>
    
    <h3>Training Data Presence</h3>
    <p>AI systems learn from web content. Brands with more presence in quality sources (Wikipedia, news sites, industry publications) have stronger representation in AI training data.</p>
    
    <h3>Platform Presence</h3>
    <p>Research shows strong correlations between platform presence and AI visibility:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Reddit</strong> — r = 0.395 correlation with Perplexity citations</li>
        <li><strong>Referring domains</strong> — r = 0.319 correlation with discovery</li>
        <li><strong>Product Hunt ranking</strong> — r = -0.286 (higher rank = more visibility)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Content Quality</h3>
    <p>Well-structured, authoritative content that directly answers questions is more likely to be cited. This includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Clear definitions and explanations</li>
        <li>Structured data and schema markup</li>
        <li>Cited statistics and sources</li>
        <li>Static HTML (AI crawlers don't execute JavaScript)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Entity Recognition</h3>
    <p>Presence in knowledge graphs (Wikipedia, Wikidata, Google Knowledge Graph) helps AI systems recognize your brand as a distinct entity.</p>

    <h2>AI Visibility vs SEO</h2>
    
    <p>AI visibility and SEO are related but distinct:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>SEO</strong> drives traffic to your website through search rankings</li>
        <li><strong>AI Visibility</strong> drives brand awareness through AI recommendations</li>
        <li><strong>SEO signals</strong> (backlinks, content quality) often improve AI visibility</li>
        <li><strong>AI visibility</strong> doesn't always drive clicks — users may get their answer without visiting your site</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The most effective strategy addresses both: SEO for website traffic and AI visibility for brand presence in AI-mediated discovery.</p>

    <h2>Improving AI Visibility</h2>
    
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Audit current state</strong> — Test how AI systems currently describe your brand</li>
        <li><strong>Build platform presence</strong> — Engage on Reddit, get listed in directories, earn backlinks</li>
        <li><strong>Create citation-worthy content</strong> — Authoritative, well-structured, factual content</li>
        <li><strong>Ensure discoverability</strong> — Static HTML, proper crawl access, schema markup</li>
        <li><strong>Monitor and correct</strong> — Track AI responses, address inaccuracies through content</li>
    </ol>
