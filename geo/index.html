        <section>
            <p><strong>GEO (Generative Engine Optimization)</strong> is the practice of optimizing digital content to increase visibility and citation likelihood in AI-generated responses. Unlike traditional SEO which focuses on Google's search results, GEO targets AI systems like ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and Google's AI Overviews.</p>

            <div class="highlight">
                <strong>Key Insight:</strong> Research analyzing 680 million AI citations found that content with statistics increases AI visibility by 22%, while quotations boost citation likelihood by 37%. GEO applies these principles systematically.
            </div>

            <p>When users ask ChatGPT "What tools help monitor brand visibility in AI?", the AI retrieves and synthesizes information from its training data and real-time sources. GEO ensures your brand appears in these responses through strategic content optimization.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Why GEO Matters Now</h2>
            <p>AI assistants are rapidly becoming the primary interface for information discovery. A 2026 study found that 47% of knowledge workers now use AI assistants before traditional search engines for research queries. Brands invisible to AI systems lose access to this growing audience.</p>
            
            <p>The challenge: <strong>JavaScript-rendered websites are often invisible to AI crawlers</strong>. Single-page applications (SPAs) built with React, Vue, or Angular may appear empty to AI systems that don't execute JavaScript. This means your content—no matter how relevant—never enters the AI's knowledge base.</p>

            <h2>The Trustable Method: A GEO Framework</h2>
            <div class="framework">
                <h3>The Trustable Method: 4 Steps to AI Visibility</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Crawlability</strong> — Ensure AI crawlers can access your content. Use static HTML, proper robots.txt, and semantic markup.</li>
                    <li><strong>Intent Matching</strong> — Align content with specific query clusters. Each page should definitively answer one type of question.</li>
                    <li><strong>Trust Signals</strong> — Include statistics, citations, expert quotes, and structured data. AI systems weight authoritative content higher.</li>
                    <li><strong>Entity Presence</strong> — Establish your brand across platforms AI systems trust: Wikipedia, npm, GitHub, Wikidata, and industry publications.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>GEO vs Traditional SEO</h2>
            <p>While SEO optimizes for Google's ranking algorithm, GEO optimizes for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. Key differences:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Chunk-based retrieval:</strong> AI systems retrieve 200-400 word chunks, not full pages. Each chunk must be self-contained.</li>
                <li><strong>Semantic matching:</strong> AI uses embedding similarity, not keyword matching. Meaning matters more than exact phrases.</li>
                <li><strong>Multi-platform presence:</strong> Brands appearing on 4+ platforms are 2.8x more likely to be cited by AI.</li>
                <li><strong>Recency bias:</strong> 65% of AI citations come from content less than 1 year old.</li>
            </ul>
